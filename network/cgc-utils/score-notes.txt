be in 
~/techx_share/scripts/cloud/control

from the head node.

./stop_workers.sh
./clean_logs.sh

you can always still use clean_logs.sh and print_jobs.sh from the original NFS scripts directory

./start_workers.sh (back in cloud/control)

/techx_share/cgc-sample-challenges/sets/will

edit protect_all.sh (if I need to change the protection configuration)

then to score, use 

score_all.sh

and then 

use 

./print_cb.sh config.zipr

To rebuild the tools, use the following commands:

build on a builder vm

and stay on the vm and then to push out a build from the builder vm, you can go to 

/techx_share/utils/pushout_techx_to_share.sh

and now back on a head node, use 
./update_32.sh 

and this takes a little bit of time. It is serial, so when output stops, we know that everything is where it needs to be.
