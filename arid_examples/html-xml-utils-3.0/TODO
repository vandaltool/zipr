Suggestions from Werner Heuser <werner.heuser@web.de>

- the program `htmlclean' has the same name as a tool from 
  the libhtmlclean-perl library. And a similar purpose.
  Also other progs have very generic names (e.g. `extract')
  Please consider to change the names, or to prefix them, e.g.
  hx_htmlclean, hx_extract, ..

- `printlinks' is a great help, but I would like some links not
  to be touched, e.g. some graphics.

- please include a download URL into the source. Imagine somebody
  likes the program and wants to come back and get the current
  version
