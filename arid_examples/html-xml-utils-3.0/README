This package is configured with automake/autoconf. Generic
instructions are in the file INSTALL. Here are some specific problems
that may arise:

1) Error when running lex:

      lex   scan.l && mv lex.yy.c scan.c
      "scan.l":line 2: Error: missing translation value

   The scan.l file uses features of flex that do not exist in lex.
   However, it is not necessary to run lex, since the file scan.c is
   provided in the package. Just do a "touch scan.c" to make sure
   "make" will not try to generate it anew.
