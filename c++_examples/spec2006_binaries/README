All benchmarks were built with the following flags
CC               = gcc
COPTIMIZE        = -O2
CXX              = g++
CXXOPTIMIZE      = -O2
EXTRA_CFLAGS     = -m32
EXTRA_CXXFLAGS   = -m32
EXTRA_FFLAGS     = -m32
FC               = gfortran
FOPTIMIZE        = -O2
FPBASE           = yes
LDCFLAGS         =
LDCXXFLAGS       =
LDFFLAGS         =



(Statically linked used LDCXXFLAGS=-static and the produced binary was verified to be statically linked using the "file" utility)
