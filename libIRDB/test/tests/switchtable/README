to test:

multiple jmp tables
	- they might be laid out one after the other

PIC, PIE
32, 64 bit
-O vs. non-optimized
library vs. non-library

induce head-merge, and tail-merge in switch case

call hell node
	fill_in_indtargs comes before fix_calls
	make sure fix_calls copies the indirect branch targets
