The makefile in src/ will build both a _debug and  _release version of the binaries.

Commandlines (requires full path of the file, no use of ..) :

./countlines <fullPath>/testData/1.java
#expected result:  RESULT:  27


./countlines <fullPath>/testData/2.java
#expected result:  RESULT: 0 

./countlines <fullPath>/testData/3.java
#expected result:  RESULT: 31 

./countlines <fullPath>/testData/4.java
#expected result:  RESULT:  4

./countlines <fullPath>/testData/5.java
#expected result:  RESULT:  4

BAD:

# mc2zk This program does not produce bad behavior on my system.
# Comments in the xml io-specification file suggest this is the output:
# <description>When the value 128 in the unsigned char is cast to a signed char it becomes -127 and that becomes the index for accessing an array. The memory location happens to contain a slash so the program terminates.</description>
# Instead, when I run this program with the reallylong file name, I receive a result of 7.
