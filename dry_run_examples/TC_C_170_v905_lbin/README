# mc2zk

The original dry run release had the key file location hardcoded into the source file.  Therefore, I moved a copy of the file named key to the src directory.

Commandlines:  All good inputs, that I gleaned from io-specifications directory and put into a file.

To find reference outputs, run without ps_analyze. These can be compared against the output listed in io-specifications/xml files.
