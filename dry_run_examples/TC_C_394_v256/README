# mc2zk

This test requires setting the environment variable "dates" to some values.  The program reads in the input from the environment variable
However, this test program currently is segfaulting for some reason.

Set dates to the following:

1) Bad

5/2/2010 5/6/2010
io-specifications directory indicates that the expected output/result for the above input is infinite looping.  However, infinite looping does not result for me.  An index variable, i, wraps around due to a loop with an improper check, which causes an out of bounds array access, which then leads to a segmentation fault due to dereferencing a bogus pointer. 

2) Bad

5/6/2011 5/2/2011

3) Good

3/7/2011 8/17/2011

4) Good

5/2/2011 5/6/2011
