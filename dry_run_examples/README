This set of directories contain source code for test cases packaged with the T&E dry run distributed 16 October 2011.

There are several directories of the naming flavor: TC_<language>_<CWE_number>_*.  Each directory contains two directories of interest:

    io-specifications/ (contains inputs for most of the test cases, often at least one good and one bad.  These are specified in xml files.)
    src/ (contains the source code for the test case)

Here's the breakdown of the CWEs included in the dry run distribution:

    121: Stack based buffer overflow.  The test case is a program which performs encryption using the solitaire cipher.  It includes a seeded vulnerability where the key buffer can be overflowed.
    170: Improper null termination.  Modified solitaire cipher program, has some differences that allow improper null termination.
    191:  Integer underflow.  Test case is a Recaman sequence generator, which has been modified to allow the index to an array can underflow (becomes negative)
    196:  Unsigned to signed conversion error.  Countlines program
    209:  Information exposure through an error message. (Not relevant to PEASOUP, I think).  business day calculation program.  Calculates the number of business days between 2 dates.  Seeded vulnerability where the error message will leak the full path name of the file to be opened.
    394:  Unexpected Status Code or Return value.  Similar business day application as above, but modified to only handle dates from 2011.  If dates outside of 2011 are given, the program comments suggest that infinite looping will occur.
    190:  Integer Overflow or Wraparound.  This is a Java source program which is an ISBN checker.  This program contains a function, passMeValue() which has been modified to print "overflow occurred" if a variable declared as a byte, overflowMe, is overflowed.
