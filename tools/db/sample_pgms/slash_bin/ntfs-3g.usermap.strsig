This tool will help you to build a mapping of Windows users
  to directory ".NTFS-3G" after mounting
to Linux users.
Trying to write file on root directory
Undecided :
Under Windows login "%s"
Usage : usermap dev1 [dev2 ...]
You have defined no group, this can cause problems
You have defined no user, no mapping can be built
* You will have to move the file "UserMapping"
