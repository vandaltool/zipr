Failed to obtain a new service provider interface (SPI) for the inbound SA from the IPsec driver. The most common cause for this is that the driver does not have the correct filter. Check your policy to verify the filters.
Failed to obtain the Kerberos server credentials for the Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP)/ERROR_IPSEC_IKE service. Kerberos authentication will not function. The most likely reason for this is lack of domain membership. This is normal if your computer is a member of a workgroup.

Indicates an ACL contains no inheritable components.
Indicates a particular SID may not be assigned as the label of an object.
Indicates a process has too many threads to perform the requested action. For example, assignment of a primary token may only be performed when a process has zero or one threads.
Indicates that an attempt was made to assign protection to a file system file or directory and one of the SIDs in the security descriptor could not be translated into a GUID that could be stored by the file system. This causes the protection attempt to fail, which may cause a file creation attempt to fail.
Indicates that an attempt was made to grow a local domain table (LDT) by setting its size, or that the size was not an even number of selectors.
Indicates that a thread attempted to terminate itself by default (called NtTerminateThread with NULL) and it was the last thread in the current process.
Indicates that the starting value for the LDT information was not an integral multiple of the selector size.
Indicates that the user supplied an invalid descriptor when trying to set up LDT descriptors.
Indicates two revision levels are incompatible.
