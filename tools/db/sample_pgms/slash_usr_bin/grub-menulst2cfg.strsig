Attempt to load the primary boot image from FILE. The rest of the line is passed verbatim as the "kernel command line".  Any modules must be reloaded after using this command. The option --type is used to suggest what type of kernel to be loaded. TYPE must be either of "netbsd", "freebsd", "openbsd", "linux", "biglinux" and "multiboot". The option --no-mem-option tells GRUB not to pass a Linux's mem option automatically.

Change the menu colors. The color NORMAL is used for most lines in the menu, and the color HIGHLIGHT is used to highlight the line where the cursor points. If you omit HIGHLIGHT, then the inverted color of NORMAL is used for the highlighted line. The format of a color is "FG/BG". FG and BG are symbolic color names. A symbolic color name must be one of these: black, blue, green, cyan, red, magenta, brown, light-gray, dark-gray, light-blue, light-green, light-cyan, light-red, light-magenta, yellow and white. But only the first eight names can be used for BG. You can prefix "blink-" to FG if you want a blinking foreground color.

Go into unattended boot mode: if the default boot entry has any errors, instead of waiting for the user to do anything, it immediately starts over using the NUM entry (same numbering as the `default' command). This obviously won't help if the machine was rebooted by a kernel that GRUB loaded.

If used in the first section of a menu file, disable all interactive editing control (menu entry editor and command line). If the password PASSWD is entered, it loads the FILE as a new config file and restarts the GRUB Stage 2. If you omit the argument FILE, then GRUB just unlocks privileged instructions.  You can also use it in the script section, in which case it will ask for the password, before continuing. The option --md5 tells GRUB that PASSWD is encrypted with md5crypt.

Initialize a serial device. UNIT is a digit that specifies which serial device is used (e.g. 0 == COM1). If you need to specify the port number, set it by --port. SPEED is the DTE-DTE speed. WORD is the word length, PARITY is the type of parity, which is one of `no', `odd' and `even'. STOP is the length of stop bit(s). The option --device can be used only in the grub shell, which specifies the file name of a tty device. The default values are COM1, 9600, 8N1.

Load a boot module FILE for a Multiboot format boot image (no interpretation of the file contents is made, so users of this command must know what the kernel in question expects). The rest of the line is passed as the "module command line", like the `kernel' command.
Load an initial ramdisk FILE for a Linux format boot image and set the appropriate parameters in the Linux setup area in memory.

Select a terminal. When multiple terminals are specified, wait until you push any key to continue. If both console and serial are specified, the terminal to which you input a key first will be selected. If no argument is specified, print current setting. The option --dumb specifies that your terminal is dumb, otherwise, vt100-compatibility is assumed. If you specify --no-echo, input characters won't be echoed. If you specify --no-edit, the BASH-like editing feature will be disabled. If --timeout is present, this command will wait at most for SECS seconds. The option --lines specifies the maximum number of lines. The option --silent is used to suppress messages.

set root='%s'; set legacy_hdbias='%s'
Set the active partition on the root disk to GRUB's root device. This command is limited to _primary_ PC partitions on a hard disk.
Set the current "root device" to the device DEVICE, then attempt to mount it to get the partition size (for passing the partition descriptor in `ES:ESI', used by some chain-loaded bootloaders), the BSD drive-type (for booting BSD kernels using their native boot format), and correctly determine  the PC partition where a BSD sub-partition is located. The optional HDBIAS parameter is a number to tell a BSD kernel how many BIOS drive numbers are on controllers before the current one. For example, if there is an IDE disk and a SCSI disk, and your FreeBSD root partition is on the SCSI disk, then use a `1' for HDBIAS.
Set the default entry to entry number NUM (if not specified, it is 0, the first entry) or the entry number saved by savedefault.

Similar to `root', but don't attempt to mount the partition. This is useful for when an OS is outside of the area of the disk that GRUB can read, but setting the correct root device is still desired. Note that the items mentioned in `root' which derived from attempting the mount will NOT work correctly.
