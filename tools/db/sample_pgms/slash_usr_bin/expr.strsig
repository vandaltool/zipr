\( and \) are not used, they return the number of characters matched or 0.
A NULL argv[0] was passed through an exec system call.
  ARG1 | ARG2       ARG1 if it is neither null nor 0, otherwise ARG2
  ARG1 & ARG2       ARG1 if neither argument is null or 0, otherwise 0
  ARG1 = ARG2       ARG1 is equal to ARG2
  ARG1 > ARG2       ARG1 is greater than ARG2
  ARG1 >= ARG2      ARG1 is greater than or equal to ARG2
  ARG1 < ARG2       ARG1 is less than ARG2
  ARG1 <= ARG2      ARG1 is less than or equal to ARG2
  ARG1 != ARG2      ARG1 is unequal to ARG2
  ARG1 - ARG2       arithmetic difference of ARG1 and ARG2
  ARG1 * ARG2       arithmetic product of ARG1 and ARG2
  ARG1 / ARG2       arithmetic quotient of ARG1 divided by ARG2
  ARG1 % ARG2       arithmetic remainder of ARG1 divided by ARG2
  ARG1 + ARG2       arithmetic sum of ARG1 and ARG2

Beware that many operators need to be escaped or quoted for shells.
