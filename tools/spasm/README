Tool to convert an assembly SPRI file into a binary SPRI file

Intended usage:
Specifying SPRI rules at the assembly language provide a higher and easier level of abstraction for developers. Consider the following transformation where we want to pad the stack frame:

Transformation:    sub esp,10 --> sub esp, 250;    // pad the stack with 240 bytes

The binary equivalent of this transformation would require specifying the opcodes correctly, i.e., a 6-byte opcode for sub instead of the original 3 bytes. Specifying this transformation at the assembly level is much simpler and less error prone; all we need to do is replace "10" with "250". 

Legend:
.  means "current PC"
-> means "map to"
** denotes instructions to be found at specified address

Format for assembly SPRI file:
	0x08ff0000 -> .
	. ** sub esp, 9
	. ** sub esp, 1
	. -> 0x08ff0003

Format for binary SPRI file:
	0x08ff0000 -> 0xffff0000
	0xffff0000 ** 3 83 ec 09
	0xffff0003 ** 3 83 ec 01
	0xffff0006 -> 0x08ff0003
